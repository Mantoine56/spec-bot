# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Mario Uomo men's clothing store requires a robust variant system to manage products with multiple size and color combinations. The current system has implementation gaps where database schema and code models are misaligned, causing variant data to be lost or incorrectly processed. This enhancement will ensure proper variant management for clothing items with attributes like size, color, fit type, and material composition.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a store administrator, I want to create products with multiple size and color variants, so that customers can select their preferred combination.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating a new product THEN the system SHALL allow adding multiple variants with size and color combinations
2. WHEN saving a product with variants THEN the system SHALL persist all variant option values (option1_value, option2_value) to the database
3. WHEN a variant is created THEN the system SHALL generate a unique item_code for each variant
4. WHEN variants are created THEN the system SHALL maintain parent-child relationships in the tabItem table
5. IF a product has variants THEN the system SHALL set has_variants flag to true on the master product

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a store administrator, I want to edit existing products and their variants, so that I can update inventory, pricing, and product details.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN editing a product THEN the system SHALL load all existing variants with their current option values
2. WHEN updating variant details THEN the system SHALL preserve existing variant IDs and relationships
3. WHEN adding new variants to existing products THEN the system SHALL create new variant records
4. WHEN removing variants THEN the system SHALL safely delete variant records and associated data
5. WHEN updating stock quantities THEN the system SHALL create appropriate stock ledger entries

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a store administrator, I want to manage stock levels for individual variants, so that I can track inventory accurately for each size/color combination.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting stock quantities for variants THEN the system SHALL create stock ledger entries
2. WHEN updating existing variant stock THEN the system SHALL calculate stock adjustments and create reconciliation entries
3. WHEN stock operations fail THEN the system SHALL continue with other operations and log errors
4. IF no warehouse exists THEN the system SHALL create a default "Main Store" warehouse
5. WHEN viewing products THEN the system SHALL display current stock levels for each variant

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the variant system to have proper data model alignment, so that all variant operations work consistently across the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Item model is defined THEN it SHALL include option1_value, option2_value, and option3_value fields
2. WHEN variant data is queried THEN the system SHALL return complete option value information
3. WHEN variants are filtered THEN the system SHALL use optimized database indexes for performance
4. WHEN variant operations are performed THEN the system SHALL log performance metrics
5. IF legacy data exists THEN the system SHALL handle missing option values gracefully

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a clothing store owner, I want variants to support clothing-specific attributes, so that customers can find products by fit, material, and style characteristics.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating clothing products THEN the system SHALL support clothing-specific fields (fit_type, primary_material, collar_type, sleeve_length, pattern_style, season)
2. WHEN variants are created THEN the system SHALL inherit clothing attributes from the master product
3. WHEN displaying products THEN the system SHALL show relevant clothing attributes for filtering and search
4. WHEN managing inventory THEN the system SHALL support clothing care instructions and material composition
5. IF formal wear flags are set THEN the system SHALL properly categorize business-appropriate clothing

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive error handling and monitoring, so that variant operations are reliable and issues can be quickly identified.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN variant operations are performed THEN the system SHALL log detailed operation information
2. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide meaningful error messages without breaking the entire operation
3. WHEN performance issues arise THEN the system SHALL automatically log slow operations (>100ms)
4. WHEN stock operations fail THEN the system SHALL continue with product updates and log the stock error separately
5. IF database constraints are violated THEN the system SHALL handle conflicts gracefully and provide user feedback

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a store administrator using the dashboard, I want to create and manage products with variants through an intuitive interface, so that I can efficiently manage my clothing inventory.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating a new product THEN the dashboard SHALL provide a variant management interface with size and color options
2. WHEN adding variants THEN the dashboard SHALL allow bulk creation with size/color combinations
3. WHEN editing existing products THEN the dashboard SHALL load and display all current variants with their stock levels
4. WHEN updating variant stock THEN the dashboard SHALL provide inline editing capabilities
5. WHEN managing variant images THEN the dashboard SHALL support drag-and-drop image assignment per variant

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a customer browsing the e-commerce site, I want to view products with their available variants and select my preferred size and color, so that I can purchase exactly what I want.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing a product THEN the e-commerce site SHALL display all available size and color options
2. WHEN selecting a variant THEN the site SHALL update the product image, price, and stock availability
3. WHEN a variant is out of stock THEN the site SHALL disable the option and show "Out of Stock" status
4. WHEN adding to cart THEN the site SHALL include the specific variant information (size, color)
5. WHEN viewing cart THEN the site SHALL clearly show variant details for each item

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a customer, I want to filter and search products by size, color, and other attributes, so that I can quickly find clothing that meets my preferences.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN browsing products THEN the e-commerce site SHALL provide filters for size, color, brand, and clothing attributes
2. WHEN applying filters THEN the site SHALL show only products that have variants matching the selected criteria
3. WHEN searching THEN the site SHALL include variant attributes in search results
4. WHEN viewing search results THEN the site SHALL highlight matching variant attributes
5. WHEN no variants match filters THEN the site SHALL show appropriate "no results" messaging

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a store administrator, I want to see comprehensive variant analytics and reporting, so that I can make informed inventory and pricing decisions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing product reports THEN the dashboard SHALL show variant-level sales data
2. WHEN analyzing inventory THEN the dashboard SHALL display stock levels by size and color
3. WHEN reviewing performance THEN the dashboard SHALL show which variants are best/worst selling
4. WHEN planning purchases THEN the dashboard SHALL provide variant-level reorder recommendations
5. WHEN exporting data THEN the dashboard SHALL include variant details in all product exports
